# Big Mart Sales Prediction

## Objective
The Big Mart Sales Prediction project aimed to build robust predictive models to forecast "Item Outlet Sales" using the Big Mart Sales Dataset. This hands-on experience focused on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to uncover hidden patterns and make accurate sales predictions.
### Skills Learned
- Advanced data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- Proficiency in exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Application of unsupervised learning methods like PCA and K-Means Clustering
- Implementation of supervised learning models including Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, and Random Forest Regression
- Evaluation and comparison of model performance

### Tools Used
- Python programming within a Jupyter Notebook environment
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms

## Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Addressed missing values by imputing mean values and introducing new categories.
- Conducted feature engineering to create new relevant features.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized data distributions and relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Identified key features influencing sales through correlation analysis.

3. Unsupervised Learning
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensionality.
- Used K-Means Clustering to group similar data points and identify patterns.

4. Supervised Learning
- Implemented Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, and Random Forest Regression to predict sales.
- Evaluated models using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
